The nice cat sat and thought about its future. He love sitting in the sun, and thinking about all the mice he was going to eat.
After a while, the cat was board and he started chasing its own tail in a frenzied amoc. The second he caght it, a shout echoed through the air - it was the shout of the cat itself, after biting its own tail off.
All the other cats looked and wondered if the too can get to such a stupidifying boredom, that will cause them to bite their tails off.
