# Input: An array of numbers

# Output: A nested array, thatg each of its items is a possible combination to
# arrange the inputted array

# We need to iterate over the inputted array, and recursively check whether we
# already found all the possible combinations, given the first x items are set.

# Input: [1, 2, 3]
# Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
